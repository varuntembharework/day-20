# Day 20 - Links, Images & File Paths (HTML)

## ðŸ“Œ Topic  
Todayâ€™s practice was focused on **links, images, and file paths** in HTML.  
I learned how to:  
- Add **external links** (`<a href="url" target="_blank">`)  
- Create **internal links** (jumping within the same page using `#id`)  
- Insert **images** using both relative file paths and absolute URLs  
- Use `alt` attributes for accessibility  
- Understand the difference between **relative vs absolute file paths**
